I'm a final year undergraduate student in economics at [Xi'an Jiaotong University (XJTU)](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn) interested in natural language processing, computer vision and multimodal learning. I was admitted to XJTU as a student in [Honors Youth Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Class_for_the_Gifted_Young#Xi'an_Jiaotong_University).

I spent a wonderful semester as a visiting student at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://wisc.edu) at Spring 2022. After that, I took a gap year and worked as a research intern at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia) during academic year 2022 -- 23. Currently, I'm working as a research intern at [WeChat AI](https://ai.weixin.qq.com), [Tencent](https://tencent.com/en-us).
